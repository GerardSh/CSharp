# Internal Types returned by LINQ
What Happens Internally: When you call a LINQ method like Select, it does not immediately execute the query. Instead, it creates an internal object that describes how to perform the query when needed. This object is an instance of a compiler-generated type that implements `IEnumerable<T>`.
Implementation Details: These internal types often have names like `WhereSelectArrayIterator<TSource, TResult>`, indicating their role in applying a projection (like Select) or filtering (like Where) operation to a source collection. These names are internal and may vary.
Accessibility: These types are designed to be internal to the LINQ library, meaning they are not accessible or visible to user code. This encapsulation ensures that the implementation can change without breaking existing code.
Deferred Execution: The internal object created by methods like Select supports deferred execution. The actual query is not performed until you enumerate the `IEnumerable<T>` (e.g., using `foreach, ToList(), Count()`, etc.). This approach allows for efficient query composition and execution.
Abstraction: By returning `IEnumerable<T>`, LINQ methods provide a common interface for various operations, hiding the complexity and details of the actual implementation. This abstraction enables powerful and flexible query capabilities without exposing the underlying mechanics.
Example to Illustrate
Consider the following example:
```
IEnumerable<int> test = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }.Select(x => x);

// The runtime type of 'test' is an internal type implementing IEnumerable<int>
Console.WriteLine(test.GetType()); // Outputs something like "System.Linq.Enumerable+WhereSelectArrayIterator`2[System.Int32,System.Int32]"
```

Summary
Internal LINQ Types: LINQ methods return objects of internal types that implement `IEnumerable<T>`, such as `WhereSelectArrayIterator<TSource, TResult>`.
Encapsulation and Deferred Execution: These types are encapsulated within the LINQ library to hide implementation details and support deferred execution, meaning queries are only executed when enumerated.
Abstraction: The use of `IEnumerable<T>` as the return type provides a consistent and powerful interface for querying, abstracting away the underlying complexity.

You
When we receive a collection from LINQ, we cannot cast it to anything, but we can use a method to transform the LINQ data type to something like or list?

ChatGPT
Exactly. When you receive a collection from a LINQ query, you cannot cast it to its internal LINQ type, but you can transform it into a different type, such as a `List<T>`, Array, or any other collection type. LINQ provides methods to facilitate this transformation.

Summary
Internal LINQ Types: LINQ methods return objects of internal types implementing `IEnumerable<T>`.
Transformations: Use methods like `ToList, ToArray, ToDictionary, and ToHashSet` to convert LINQ results into other collection types.
Practical Use: These transformation methods provide a way to work with the LINQ results in different contexts where specific collection types are needed.
# Understanding Read-Only Collections and Type Casting in .NET
`IReadOnlyCollection<T>`: An interface that provides a read-only view of a collection. It allows iteration and indexing but not modification, ensuring that the collection cannot be altered through this interface.

`ReadOnlyCollection<T>`: A concrete class that wraps an existing collection (e.g., `List<T>`) and implements `IReadOnlyCollection<T>`. It provides a read-only view and does not expose methods for modifying the collection.

Casting and Access: When a collection is returned as `IReadOnlyCollection<T>`, you cannot cast it back to the original collection type (e.g., `List<T>`) to modify it. The cast fails because `ReadOnlyCollection<T>` or similar wrappers are different types implementing `IReadOnlyCollection<T>` but do not expose modification methods.

Internal State: `ReadOnlyCollection<T>` holds a reference to the original collection but only exposes read-only functionality. You cannot access or modify the internal collection through the `IReadOnlyCollection<T>` interface.

Analogy: If `IReadOnlyCollection<T>` is like an interface representing various animals (e.g., `IAnimal`), and `ReadOnlyCollection<T>` is a specific type like `Cat`, then `List<T>` is another specific type like `Dog`. If you have a `Cat` instance (i.e., `ReadOnlyCollection<T>`), you cannot cast it back to a `Dog` (i.e., `List<T>`) because `Cat` and `Dog` are distinct types, even though they both implement `IAnimal` (i.e., `IReadOnlyCollection<T>`).

This design ensures that while consumers can read and query the collection, they cannot alter its contents, maintaining encapsulation and immutability.
