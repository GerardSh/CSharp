## Redeclaring the Interface
You
Why there is a difference if the derived class re-declares the interface like it is the case with `MyClass3` in the example below?
`MyClass2` and `MyClass3` are both hiding the `MyMethod()` implementation in `MyClass` with new implementations, however when we make a variable of `MyInterface` type and initialize it with `MyClass2` and `MyClass3` data, only `MyMethod()` in the `MyClass3` was overridden successfully, `MyClass2` still uses the `MyClass` implementation. The only difference between the two is that `MyClass3` re-declares `MyInterface`, where `MyClass2` is inheriting it thru `MyClass`:

```
public interface MyInterface
{
    void MyMethod();
}

public class MyClass : MyInterface
{
    public void MyMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MyClass");
    }
}

public class MyClass2 : MyClass
{
    public new void MyMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MyClass2");
    }
}
// Re-declaring MyInterface
public class MyClass3 : MyClass, MyInterface
{
    public new void MyMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MyClass3");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        MyInterface myInterface = new MyClass2();
        myInterface.MyMethod(); // Output: MyClass

        MyInterface myInterface2 = new MyClass3();
        myInterface2.MyMethod(); // Output: MyClass3
    }
}
```

When we redeclare the interface is like we start a new chain where the classes below will use the new interface implementation if there is any?

ChatGPT
Yes, redeclaring the interface in a derived class effectively creates a new implementation chain for that interface starting from the derived class. This can be useful when you want to ensure that a specific implementation of the interface method is used from that point in the hierarchy onwards, regardless of the base class's implementation.

Here's an example to demonstrate how redeclaring the interface affects the method resolution:

```
public interface MyInterface
{
    void MyMethod();
}

public class MyClass : MyInterface
{
    public void MyMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MyClass");
    }
}

public class MyClass2 : MyClass
{
    public new void MyMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MyClass2");
    }
}

public class MyClass3 : MyClass2, MyInterface
{
    // Explicitly redeclare the interface implementation
    public new void MyMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MyClass3");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        MyInterface myClass = new MyClass();
        myClass.MyMethod(); // Output: MyClass

        MyInterface myClass2 = new MyClass2();
        myClass2.MyMethod(); // Output: MyClass

        MyInterface myClass3 = new MyClass3();
        myClass3.MyMethod(); // Output: MyClass3
    }
}

```

Explanation

1. **Initial Implementation**: `MyClass` implements `MyInterface` and provides a method `MyMethod`.
2. **Method Hiding**: `MyClass2` hides `MyMethod` with the `new` keyword. This does not affect calls through the interface.
3. **Redeclaring the Interface**: `MyClass3` redeclares the `MyInterface` and provides a new implementation of `MyMethod`.

Behavior

- When `MyMethod` is called on an instance of `MyClass` through `MyInterface`, it uses `MyClass`'s implementation.
- When `MyMethod` is called on an instance of `MyClass2` through `MyInterface`, it still uses `MyClass`'s implementation because `MyClass2` hides the method but does not affect the interface implementation.
- When `MyMethod` is called on an instance of `MyClass3` through `MyInterface`, it uses `MyClass3`'s implementation because `MyClass3` redeclares the interface and provides a new implementation.

 Key Points

- **Redeclaring an Interface**: When a derived class redeclares an interface, it starts a new chain for that interface, ensuring that its implementation is used from that point onward.
- **Method Hiding vs. Overriding**: Use `new` to hide a method but remember it does not affect the interface method resolution. Use `override` to change the method behavior in the derived class while preserving polymorphism.

Conclusion

Redeclaring an interface in a derived class is like starting a new implementation chain for that interface. This ensures that any calls to the interface methods on instances of that derived class (or its subclasses) will use the new implementation provided in the derived class.

You
We can achieve the same result if we make the method virtual in the base class that implements the interface?

ChatGPT
Yes, making the method virtual in the base class that implements the interface allows derived classes to override that method, which is a more typical and straightforward approach in object-oriented programming. This approach maintains polymorphism and allows the method's behavior to be customized in derived classes without needing to redeclare the interface.
## Explicit interface implementation
You
When we do explicit interface implementation, the method will not be available when we call the method thru an instance of the class and not the interface?

ChatGPT
Yes, you are correct. The difference between the two forms of implementation lies in the visibility and accessibility of the method when dealing with instances of the class versus instances of the interface. Here's a detailed explanation:

Implicit Interface Implementation

```
public class MyClass3 : MyClass2, MyInterface
{
    public void MyMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MyClass3");
    }
}
```

Characteristics:

1. **Visibility**:
- The `MyMethod` is public and accessible through instances of both `MyClass3` and `MyInterface`.
2. **Method Resolution**:
- When you call `MyMethod` on an instance of `MyClass3`, it will execute `MyClass3`'s implementation.
- When you call `MyMethod` on an instance of `MyInterface`, which is implemented by `MyClass3`, it will also execute `MyClass3`'s implementation.

`MyClass3 myClass3 = new MyClass3(); myClass3.MyMethod(); // Output: MyClass3  MyInterface myInterface = new MyClass3(); myInterface.MyMethod(); // Output: MyClass3`

Explicit Interface Implementation

```
public class MyClass3 : MyClass2, MyInterface
{
    void MyInterface.MyMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MyClass3");
    }
}
```

Characteristics:

1. **Visibility**:
- The `MyMethod` is only accessible through instances of `MyInterface`.
- It is not accessible directly through instances of `MyClass3`.
2. **Method Resolution**:
- When you call `MyMethod` on an instance of `MyInterface`, it will execute the explicit interface implementation in `MyClass3`.
- When you call `MyMethod` on an instance of `MyClass3`, there is no direct method to call, and the compiler will raise an error if you try to call `MyMethod`.

Example:

```
MyClass3 myClass3 = new MyClass3();
// myClass3.MyMethod(); // Error: 'MyClass3' does not contain a definition for 'MyMethod'

MyInterface myInterface = new MyClass3();
myInterface.MyMethod(); // Output: MyClass3

```

Summary:

- **Implicit Implementation**: The method is public and part of the class's public interface. It can be called directly on the class instance and through the interface.
- **Explicit Implementation**: The method is only part of the interface and can only be called through an interface reference. It is not part of the class's public interface, meaning you cannot call it directly on the class instance.

Practical Use Cases:

- **Implicit Implementation**: Useful when the method should be publicly accessible and used both through the class instance and the interface.
- **Explicit Implementation**: Useful when you want to provide a specific implementation for an interface method that should not be part of the class's public API. This can help avoid naming conflicts and make the class's API cleaner.
